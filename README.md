# Screenshot tool

Built to automate the cryptoslam reporting. This tool generates a screenshot of the table, and scrapes the relevant fields from Cryptoslam & Immutascan. It's sketchy but it works.

## Prerequisites

Use node v16+, and install dependancies with `npm i `

## Run

`npm run-script screenshot` to execute the app.
